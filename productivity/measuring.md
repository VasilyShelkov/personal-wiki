## [Can developer productivity be measured](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/07/measuring-developer-productivity/)

### Bad metrics

- hours worked is a false metric: "everyone is working but nothing is getting done".
- Paying someone more money doesn’t immediately make them more productive
- measuring a developer’s productivity by how much code they contribute is like measuring a power plant by how much waste they produce or measuring Congress by how many bills they pass; it’s tangential to actual value.
- A developer who gets paid per line of code can easily earn an entire year’s salary in a single day without creating any business value whatsoeve
- Measuring productivity in terms of bugs fixed, tasks completed, or features shipped is equally futile, if marginally more difficult to game. developers can write buggy software to fix more bugs, write software quickly and naively to ship more features, pick up easy tasks to finish more of them.

### Good metrics

- it's a team sport, not individual, look at a team's output of delivering working software.
- does this team consistently produce useful software on a timescale of weeks to months
- teammates tend to be well aware of each other’s contributions, getting feedback and often exercising personal accountability will help developers measure performance.
